# Drowsiness-Detection-System
install  1. OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (Face and eye detection).
2. Imutils – pip install imutils (To get landmarks of eye).
3. Scipy – pip install scipy (To calculate distance between eye landmarks).
4. Pygame – pip install pygame (To play alarm sound).
5.      Dlib - pip install dlib

 Developed a  Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib's facial landmarks.
 Utilized the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) technique to detect drowsiness by tracking eye movements.
 Integrated Pygame for audio alerts and SciPy for precise eye landmark calculations, enhancing driver safety and monitoring systems
